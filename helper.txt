1. Create Django project from the menu file !

2. Copy templates into the templates dir.

3. Copy static into static folder staticfile for example.

4. In terminal use python manage.py startapp (web) for example.

5. Move the app folder into project dir.

6. Made urls.py in web(project) dir. -- > made urlpatterns=() or list.

7. Then in urls.py in the project dir add the path of web/urls.py with include('project.web.urls')

8. Add into the settings.py in installed apps list your project ('project.web.')

9. Made your database in settings.py DATABASES , click on the comment link to use the code for postgres,setup
	your postgres project_name , user , pass , etc.
	
10.Then connect to the your DBMS and make new database with the same name like in the project settings.py database name:

11.In settings.py add STATICFILES_DIR = ( BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

12.Install psycopg2 for linux ot mac use binary, for example pip install psycopg2-binary

13.Make requirements.txt with terminal command pip freeze > requirements.txt (You have to see this file in the base dir)

14.Run your project python manage.py runserver 8000

15.Test it in browser,test if your static dir works with load some file , 
	for example style.css http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/css/style.css
	
16.Lets setup the urls in urls.py in web dir / make sure to use <int:pk>/ on edit or delete path

    	{% endblock %} to use the inheritence inside the block , then copy the closing tag with rest of the code(be careful)
	Do it for all templates
	
22. GO to every html pages from templates cut the part used in base.html , then add {%  extends 'base/base.html' %}
	{% block page_content %} and in the bottom cutted part use: {% endblock %}

29. If some is optional : null=True,  blank=True
   -- If validator is a class use @deconstructible !

30. When finish the validation , If validators works then create in the project file validators.py
	 and some clas try to made migration, first install Pillow to made 	the migrate: pip install Pillow 	then pip freeze > 	reqirements.txt to update the requirements
